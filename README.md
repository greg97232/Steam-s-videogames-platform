# Company's description ðŸ“‡
Steam is a [video game digital distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_distribution_of_video_games) service and storefront from [Valve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation). It was launched as a software client in September 2003 to provide game updates automatically for Valve's games, and expanded to distributing third-party titles in late 2005. Steam offers various features, like [digital rights management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) (DRM), [game server matchmaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchmaking_(video_games)) with [Valve Anti-Cheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Anti-Cheat) measures, [social networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service), and [game streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_live_streaming) services. Steam client's functions include game update automation, cloud storage for [game progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_game), and community features such as direct messaging, in-game overlay functions and a virtual [collectable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectable) marketplace.
  
# Project ðŸš§
You're working for [Ubisoft](https://app.jedha.co/course/project-steam-ft/www.ubisoft.com), a French video game publisher. They'd like to release a new revolutionary videogame! They asked you conduct a global analysis of the games available on Steam's marketplace in order to better understand the videogames ecosystem and today's trends.

# Goals ðŸŽ¯
The ultimate goal of this project is to understand what factors affect the popularity or sales of a video game. But your boss asked you to take advantage of this opportunity to analyze the video game market globally.

To carry out this project, you will have to adopt different levels of analysis. Your boss gave you a list of examples of questions that would be interesting:

Analysis at the "macro" level

Which publisher has released the most games on Steam?

What are the best rated games?

Are there years with more releases? Were there more or fewer game releases during the Covid, for example?

How are the prizes distributed? Are there many games with a discount?

What are the most represented languages?

Are there many games prohibited for children under 16/18?

Genres analysis

What are the most represented genres?

Are there any genres that have a better positive/negative review ratio?

Do some publishers have favorite genres?

What are the most lucrative genres?

Platform analysis

Are most games available on Windows/Mac/Linux instead?

Do certain genres tend to be preferentially available on certain platforms?

You're free to follow these guidelines, or to choose a different angle of analysis, as long as your analysis reveals relevant and useful information. ðŸ¤“


# Clustering is your friend
Clustering technics are a perfect fit for the job. Think about it, all the pickup locations can be gathered into different clusters. You can then use cluster coordinates to pin hot zones ðŸ˜‰  

# Create maps with plotly
Check out [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) documentation, you can create maps and populate them easily. Obviously, there are other libraries but this one should do the job pretty well.  

# Deliverable ðŸ“¬
To complete this project, your team should:

Have a map with hot-zones using any python library ( or anything else).plotly  
You should at least describe hot-zones per day of week.  
Compare results with at least two unsupervised algorithms like KMeans and DBScan.  
Your maps should look something like this:
