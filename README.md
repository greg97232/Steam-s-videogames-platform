# Company's description 📇
Steam is a video game digital distribution service and storefront from Valve. It was launched as a software client in September 2003 to provide game updates automatically for Valve's games, and expanded to distributing third-party titles in late 2005. Steam offers various features, like digital rights management (DRM), game server matchmaking with Valve Anti-Cheat measures, social networking, and game streaming services. Steam client's functions include game update automation, cloud storage for game progress, and community features such as direct messaging, in-game overlay functions and a virtual collectable marketplace.
  
# Scope of this project 🖼️
To start off, Uber wants to try this feature in New York city. Therefore you will only focus on this city. Data can be found here:  

👉👉[ Uber Trip Data ](https://full-stack-bigdata-datasets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Machine+Learning+non+Supervis%C3%A9/Projects/uber-trip-data.zip)👈👈  

_You only need to focus on New York City for this project_  

# Clustering is your friend
Clustering technics are a perfect fit for the job. Think about it, all the pickup locations can be gathered into different clusters. You can then use cluster coordinates to pin hot zones 😉  

# Create maps with plotly
Check out [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) documentation, you can create maps and populate them easily. Obviously, there are other libraries but this one should do the job pretty well.  

# Deliverable 📬
To complete this project, your team should:

Have a map with hot-zones using any python library ( or anything else).plotly  
You should at least describe hot-zones per day of week.  
Compare results with at least two unsupervised algorithms like KMeans and DBScan.  
Your maps should look something like this:
